## üìö Homeworks

### Homework 1 - RGB Led controlled by potentiometers

- **Task requirement**: This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers.
- **Description**: This implementation involves three main steps: Find the limit of each potentiometer, adding the RGB LED to the circuit and finalizing the code.

### Homework #2 - Elevator simulator

- **Task requirement**: This  assignment  involves  simulating  a  3-floor  elevator  control  system  usingLEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. Follow me in order to gain experience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques,and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios.
- **Description**: This project effectively integrates button control with elevator operation, creating a functional elevator simulation. Users can initiate elevator calls and track its floor-to-floor movement using LEDs to represent floor levels. Auditory feedback is provided through a buzzer. Notably, the code is structured with separate methods, improving code readability and maintainability. It serves as a practical example of how to implement an interactive project with a well-organized code structure.
