### Homework 1 - RGB Led controlled by potentiometers

- **Task requirement**: This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers.
- **Description**: This implementation involves three main steps: Find the limit of each potentiometer, adding the RGB LED to the circuit and finalizing the code.
